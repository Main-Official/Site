			Why Sports?
		</h2>	
			<p>
				By participating in sports activities in general, children’s social skills are likely to come alive as it is a fantastic facilitator to promote social interaction, cooperation, teamwork and friendship. Research has also
				shown how sports can improve problem solving skills, build self-discipline, respect for authority and team-mates, trust, leadership and coping skills. Confidence is a huge factor for children and participation in sports will only assist the development of character. Children with enhanced self esteem will inevitably be more comfortable in their own skin and therefore be well placed to proceed well in their early school and social lives.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="float-left">			
		<h2>Why Education?</h2>
			<p>
				Proper and good education is very important for all of us. It facilitates quality learning all through the life among people of any age group, cast, creed, religion and region. It is the process of achieving knowledge, values, skills, beliefs, and moral habits. People need to get high level awareness about the importance of knowledge more than before. Education is very necessary for each and everyone in order to improve knowledge, way of living as well as social and economic status throughout life.
