				<h4>Fighting Cancer Through Soccer – Fezile Hlophe’s Story</h4>
				<p>
					Meet Fezile Hlophe. In 2015, Fezile joined Diski Nine9 as a soccer referee at 15 years of age. Fezile is a throat cancer survivor who has become South Africa’s youngest professional soccer referee at age 16 when he officiated a professional soccer match between Kaizer Chiefs vs. University of Pretoria. Diski Nine9 has worked with Absa to make a short film titled “Madala” about Fezile’s life in an effort to raise funds to provide extra lessons to help Fezile pass grade 11 and grade 12. Due to cancer treatment, Fezile was in and out of school for 2 years and as a result, his education suffered. With the help of Absa, Fezile
					managed to finish high school. The short film seen by over 1 million people on social media was seen by John Carlin, the author of Invictus the bestselling book that was turned into a Hollywood blockbuster. John Carlin requested Diski Nine9 to tell Fezile’s story in an Amazon Original 6 part documentary called This is Football that premiered globally on 2 August 2019. Through working on This is Football, Diski Nine9, John
					Carlin and the Harry Crossley Foundation identified Fezile’s talent in front of the camera and have raised funding for Fezile to enrol at a film school in 2020. We believe that Fezile’s love for film and sports will make him a great sports TV journalist and presenter in the future.
