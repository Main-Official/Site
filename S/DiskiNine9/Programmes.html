		<h2>School & Sports Holiday Programme</h2>
		<div>
			<p>The flagship of the organisation and the reason why Diski Nine9 was initially established. The School and Sports Holiday Programme focuses on primary and high school learners between the ages of 10-18 years. These learners receive life-skills education on leadership, problem solving, conflict resolution and team work, while their coaches receive entrepreneurship and coaching skills before participating in a competitive soccer and netball tournament during the 8-10 days of the programme. The focus of this programme is to engage with Youths.

		<h2>After School Programme</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				Diski Nine9 has an After-School Programme in 2 primary schools in Soweto. The aim of the after school programme is to provide additional academic support to learners interested in soccer, netball and athletics. The academic support focuses on reading, debate and spelling bees. The focus of this programme is to educate Youths.

		<h2>Greater Protea Netball League</h2>
		<div>
			<p>
				The Greater Protea Netball League is a new initiative established by Diski Nine9 in an attempt to level out the playing field by affording girls an opportunity to participate in a structured long term tournament that keeps them busy and off the streets with the aim of reducing adverse behaviour in the community. Established in 2020, the league commenced with four divisions, U13, U16, U19 and Open. The league runs for 8 months from March to October annually.
